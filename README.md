# EasyC4 for diagrams.net

---

Please also check the **newest version** of my plugin available at https://github.com/hycomsa/hycom-c4

The new version contains slightly smaller, more compact elements - seems to be more readable. You also find there additional types of containers - web browser and mobile application. Maybe new version will be more suitable for you.

The **EasyC4** library is for quick and convenient visualising software architecture using the **C4 model** approach. The library contains a set of aesthetic **C4 notation** elements and lets you create C4 diagrams in the *diagrams.net* / *draw.io* application.

The **EasyC4** provides the following easy to use elements:
- Person (internal and external)
- Software system (internal and external)
- Container (generic, data, microservice and message bus)
- Component
- Relationship (with description and technology, with description only and plain)
- Scope boundary (software system and container)
- Diagram title (for system context, containers and components diagrams)
- Legend
