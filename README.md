# EasyC4 for diagrams.net

---

Please check the **newest version** of my plugin available at https://github.com/hycomsa/hycom-c4

The new version contains slightly smaller, more compact elements - seems to be more readable. You also find there an additional type of container - mobile application - and deployment node boundary. Maybe a new version will be more suitable for you.

The **EasyC4** library is for quick and convenient visualising software architecture using the **C4 model** approach. The library contains a set of aesthetic **C4 notation** elements and lets you create C4 diagrams in the *diagrams.net* / *draw.io* application.

The **EasyC4** provides the following easy to use elements:
- Person (internal and external)
- Software system (internal and external)
- Container (generic, data, microservice and message bus)
- Component
- Relationship (with description and technology, with description only and plain)
- Scope boundary (software system and container)
- Diagram title (for system context, containers and components diagrams)
- Legend

# Tips
## Manually Resizing Elements
Elements will by default try to automatically resize to fit the description and other text.

If you however need to manually resize items you need to activate the "Resizable" checkbox in the "Property / Value" table within the "Format Panel".

After that you will be able to change the size of the element.

If the "Format Panel" is not visible then you can show it by clicking one of the icon on the right top.
